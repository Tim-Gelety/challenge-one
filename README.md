# Refactored Website

AS A marketing agency\
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards\
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Refactoring Objectives

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards\
WHEN I view the source code\
~~THEN I find semantic HTML elements~~\
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements\
~~THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning~~\
WHEN I view the image elements\
~~THEN I find accessible alt attributes~~\
WHEN I view the heading attributes\
~~THEN they fall in sequential order~~\
WHEN I view the title element\
~~THEN I find a concise, descriptive title~~

## Objective Implementation

<ul>  
  <li> 'div' tags replaced with more descriptve tags </li>
  <li> descriptions placed in 'alt' tags for 'section' images </li>
  <li> heading element 'h1' through 'h4' are used </li>
  <li> 'title' tag changed from 'website' to 'horiseon-ad-page' </li>
</ul>

## Aditional Changes

<ul>
  <li> broken nav element fixed </li>
  <li> scout rule applied </li>
  <li> consolidated CSS style rules </li>
  <li> notations are present in code for additional changes </li> 
</ul>
